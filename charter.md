# Draft Charter for Media over QUIC

Media over QUIC (moq) will work on solution for a simple low-latency 
media delivery protocol that is common across ingest and distribution. 
This work may address use cases including live streaming, gaming, and 
media conferencing and allows efficient scaling. The solution supports 
both web browsers and simple devices that donâ€™t contain embedded browsers. 
 
The work focuses building protocol mechanisms for publication of media 
and ways to identify and receive the media.

The media publication protocol will be a push protocol for sending 
media including audio, video, and timed metadata.
The common protocol for publishing media over ingest and distribution 
will support:

* one or more media formats, 
* an interoperable way to request media and encodings,
* adaptation strategies for different media qualities, 
* timestamp of media,
* prioritization of media, 
* a cache friendly media mechanisms. 

Media will be mapped onto underlying QUIC mechanisms (QUIC Streams and/or
QUIC datagrams) and can be used over raw QUIC or WebTransport.

The proposed solution provides extensibility for supporting different media
container formats (including CMAF) and shall specify a mandatory to implement
container format to ensure interoperability. Support for multiple media types,
media encodings and prioritization schemes shall be proposed, in addition to a
simple method of authentication to access media streams as well as carrying
information for additional decryption of media payloads where required.
 
The mechanism to name and request media will enable:

* Requesting server start sending media related to given point in the stream
* Cue points
* Integration with captions
* Selection of desire encoding ( choosing language, bit rate , etc ) 
 
The MOQ architecture allows for the use of optional relays as first 
class elements of the design. The media publication protocol can 
leverage on-path relays/caches wherever applicable to improve the 
media quality. Even when media is end-to-end encrypted, the relays
can access some metadata needed for caching such as timestamp,
priority and so on.
 
This working group will not propose changes to underlying QUIC 
transport, but may propose requirements for QUIC extensions to the QUIC WG. This working 
group will not define signaling mechanisms for discovery of relay or 
media producers or consumers. 
 
This working group will coordinate with the QUIC and WebTransport working 
groups as needed. It will liaise with MPEG-DASH, and W3C WebTransport 
as appropriate.
